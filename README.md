# Metal Identification using Deep Learning
### Task Overview
#### Task Description

This project focuses on the identification of various metals, including Copper, Brass, Steel, and Non-Metal objects, utilizing Deep Learning and Computer Vision techniques. The primary goal is to develop a model capable of classifying input images into one of these categories.

#### Key Steps

##### Data Collection:
Collect images from a provided zip file containing examples of Copper, Brass, Steel, and Non-Metal objects.

##### Annotation:
Annotate images by categorizing them into specific classes, such as Copper, Brass, Steel, or Non-Metal.

##### Data Splitting:
Split the annotated dataset into training, testing, and validation sets to ensure robust model evaluation.

##### Model Training:
Train a deep learning model using the VGG16 architecture for image classification.

##### Model Evaluation:
Evaluate the model's performance on both the test and validation sets, using relevant metrics to gauge accuracy.

##### GitHub Repository:
Create a private GitHub repository to host the organized code and documentation for the project.

##### Documentation:
Include clear comments within the code and a README file providing instructions, overview, and details.

##### Submission:
Share the GitHub repository link for code review.
